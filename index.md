The 2018 Physics of Estuaries and Coastal Seas meeting will be held in Galveston, TX at the historical [Tremont hotel](http://www.thetremonthouse.com/) near [the Strand](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strand_Historic_District). Meeting dates are planned for October 15-19, 2018.

Initial plans were to hold the meeting at UTMSI in Port Aransas, TX, but Port Aransas was strongly affected by Hurricane Harvey, the same hurricane that caused massive flooding in Houston, TX. Recovery has been slow along the south Texas coast, and the facilities are still under repair, and it is not anticipated the meeting rooms and facilities will be ready by 2018.

Hope to see you in Galveston,

The organizing committee: 
   - Rob Hetland
   - Dave Ralston
   - Julie Pietrzak
