The 2018 Physics of Estuaries and Coastal Seas meeting was scheduled to take place in the fall at the University of Texas Marine Science Institute in Port Aransas, TX. The tentative dates for the meeting are October 16-19, 2018.

Port Aransas was strongly affected by Hurricane Harvey, the same hurricane that caused massive flooding in Houston, TX. Recovery has been slow along the south Texas coast, and the facilities are still under repair, but scheduled to be operational again in early spring of 2018.

There still exists the slight possibility that the facility will not be available in the Fall of 2018, and would not be available for our meeting. I am working to identify alternate locations nearby, but am hopeful that UTMSI will be up and running in plenty of time for our meeting. I think it is important to still try to have our meeting along the Texas Coast, in the region affected by the hurricane in order to see the effects firsthand, and to support the community.

The organizing committee: Rob Hetland, Dave Ralston, and Julie Pietrzak
