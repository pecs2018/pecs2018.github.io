# Activities and outings 

## Wednesday, October 17

We plan to have a number of outings on the afternoon of Wednesday, October 18. We will have one main organized activity that will include a boat and bus tour of Galveston Island. Due to limitations in the number of passengers on the boat, we can only allow 88 people on this tour. There are a number of other options; group transportation and organization of these events will be dependent on the level of interest. Events other than the boat/bus tour will likely have some additional charges, and approximate costs are listed.
